# ConnectedVehicles V1.0

This project is developed as a Coding test for the below problem and this is the Front end UI that would be connected to the backend service in https://github.com/Thangaricky/CarStatus

Scenario:
Imagine you are an Alten consultant and you got assigned to a project at one of our top partners. They have a number of connected vehicles that belongs to a number of customers. They have a need to be able to view the status of the connection among these vehicles on a monitoring display.

The vehicles send the status of the connection one time per minute. The status can be compared with a ping (network trace); no request from the vehicle means no connection.

Task:
Your task will be to create a data store that keeps these vehicles with their status and the customers who own them, as well as a GUI (preferably web-based) that displays the status. How the GUI is designed is up to you, as well as how you chose to implement the features and use suitable technologies.

Obviously, for this task, there are no real vehicles available that can respond to your "ping" request. This can either be solved by using static values or ??by creating a separate machinery that returns random fake status.
